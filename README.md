## How Emergency Detection Works

### Technical Implementation
- **Accessibility Service**: Globally detects key combinations even when screen is off
- **Background Service**: Handles location retrieval and SMS sending
- **Wake Locks**: Ensures emergency detection works when device is sleeping
- **Simultaneous Detection**: Detects Volume Up + Power button pressed within 500ms of each other
- **Hold Duration**: Requires 1-second hold to prevent accidental triggers

### Emergency Message Format
```
üö® EMERGENCY ALERT üö®
I need help! My location:
Latitude: XX.XXXXXX
Longitude: XX.XXXXXX

Google Maps: https://maps.google.com/?q=XX.XXXXXX,XX.XXXXXX

Sent automatically by emergency detection.
```

### SMS Auto-Response Triggers
The app automatically responds to messages containing:
- "give me your location"
- "send location" 
- "where are you"
- "share location"
- "your location"
- "location please"
- "send me location"

### Auto-Response Message Format
```
üìç My current location:
Latitude: XX.XXXXXX
Longitude: XX.XXXXXX
Accuracy: XX.Xm

üó∫Ô∏è Google Maps: https://maps.google.com/?q=XX.XXXXXX,XX.XXXXXX

‚è∞ Sent automatically in response to your request
```
